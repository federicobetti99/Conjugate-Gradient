PARALLEL AND HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING - PROJECT

This repository contains the Conjugate Gradient
implementation with MPI Interface and CUDA kernels.

The given example is a 5-points stencil for the
2D Laplace problem. The matrix is in sparse format.

The matrix format is [Matrix Market format (.mtx extension)](https://sparse.tamu.edu/). 
You can use other matrices there or create your own.
